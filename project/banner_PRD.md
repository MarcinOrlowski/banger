# Python Banner Tool PRD

**Ticket**: N/A (Internal project)

## Problem Statement

The classic Unix `banner` command isn't available on many modern Linux distributions, forcing
developers to find alternatives for creating ASCII art text. Users need a simple, cross-platform
tool to generate large-letter text displays for terminals, documentation headers, and system
notifications.

## Solution Overview

Create a Python-based replacement for the banner command that prints text in large ASCII letters
using the classic 7-line font. The tool will be command-line compatible with the original banner
while being easily installable via pip. Success means users can type `banger "HELLO"` and see the
same output as the classic Unix tool.

## User Stories

1. As a developer, I want to display text in large ASCII letters, so that I can create visible
   headers in terminal output
2. As a system administrator, I want to use banner in scripts, so that I can create prominent
   notifications
3. As a user, I want the tool to respect my terminal width, so that output displays correctly
   without wrapping

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Supports all uppercase letters A-Z, numbers 0-9, and common special characters
- [ ] Automatically converts lowercase input to uppercase
- [ ] Detects terminal width and truncates output appropriately
- [ ] Displays each command-line argument as a separate banner
- [ ] Compatible with original banner command syntax
- [ ] Installable via pip as `banger`
- [ ] Works on Python 3.8+ on Linux, macOS, and Windows

## Out of Scope

- Multiple font styles (only classic 7-line font)
- Color support
- Lowercase letter rendering
- Unicode character support
- Configuration files
- Web API or GUI interface
- Font editor or creation tools

## Success Metrics

1. Tool produces identical output to classic banner for same inputs
2. Installation via pip completes in under 30 seconds
3. Character rendering completes in under 100ms for 10-character strings
