# Cross-Platform Configuration File Support PRD

**Ticket**: [#0004: Refactor config file support to OS agnostic handling](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/banger/issues/4)

## Problem Statement

The banger application currently uses hardcoded Unix-style configuration paths (`~/.config/banger/`) which only work on Linux/Unix systems. Windows and macOS users cannot use the configuration file feature, limiting the application's cross-platform compatibility. This creates a poor user experience for approximately 60% of potential users on non-Unix platforms.

## Solution Overview

Implement OS-agnostic configuration file handling using the `platformdirs` library to automatically determine the correct configuration directory for each operating system. The solution will maintain backward compatibility by migrating existing Unix configuration files to the new location. Success means configuration files work seamlessly across Linux, macOS, and Windows without user intervention.

## User Stories

1. As a Windows user, I want to use configuration files to set default fonts and banner settings, so that I can customize banger behavior without command-line arguments
2. As a macOS user, I want my configuration file stored in the proper Application Support directory, so that it follows macOS conventions and integrates with system backups
3. As a Linux user, I want my existing configuration to automatically migrate to the new system, so that I don't lose my current settings
4. As a developer, I want the configuration system to work consistently across all platforms, so that I can provide uniform documentation and support

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Configuration files are stored in OS-appropriate directories (Linux: ~/.config, macOS: ~/Library/Application Support, Windows: AppData/Roaming)
- [ ] Existing Linux configuration files are automatically migrated to the new location
- [ ] The `--config-init` command creates configuration files in the correct OS-specific location
- [ ] Help text and documentation reflect the new cross-platform behavior
- [ ] All existing configuration functionality continues to work without changes
- [ ] No breaking changes to the configuration file format or CLI interface

## Out of Scope

- Changes to configuration file format (remains YAML)
- New configuration options or settings
- Configuration file validation beyond current implementation
- GUI configuration management tools
- Configuration file synchronization across devices

## Success Metrics

1. Configuration files work correctly on all three major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) within 1 release cycle
2. Zero user reports of configuration migration issues within 30 days of release
3. No regression in existing configuration functionality as measured by test suite
